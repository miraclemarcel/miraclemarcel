- ðŸ‘‹ My name is Miracle and I am a Frontend Software Developer. I enjoy using my skills to contribute to exciting technological projects. 
I know technology can bring true revolution in all fields of work and I have a good foundation of software-related knowledge to work in a better way.
so far, I've worked on different projects using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and React.js. But I never stop learning, as technology keeps evolving. 
If youâ€™d like to learn more about how we can work together, please reach out anytime!. 
It would be an honor to work with you!
